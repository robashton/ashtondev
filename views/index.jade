    h2 Hiring me
    p I like to build long term relationships with clients
    p I charge an affordable ~Â£500 a day
    p I prefer to work on projects for short term sprints (1-2 weeks)
    p I prefer to move around during the day, coffee shops are my ideal work environment
    p I will work on anything, if I don't know it, I <strong>will</strong> learn it.
    p I will leave behind a legacy of improvement and change
