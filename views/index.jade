  #who
    h2 What do I do?
    p I'm a freelance developer focused on short-term/high-value sprints, helping teams who are in need of a hand to <em>get stuff done</em>.
    p I don't live anywhere, preferring to remain mobile and have the flexibility to travel to client sites over the globe.
    p I generally work remote, but like (if feasible) to spend some time with the team in person wherever that might be.
